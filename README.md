Don't Look Back - Script and Assets Dump
---------------------------------------------------

The source code and assets for Don't Look Back.

Decompiled with [JPEXS FFDec](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) and [AS3Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/as3hx), [FlashDevelop](https://github.com/fdorg/flashdevelop) and lots of hard work for the compiling Haxe port.

Port availible for compilation in FlashDevelop. (It's SWF can be found [here](https://github.com/buggemgames/dontlookback/raw/refs/heads/main/haxe/bin/haxe.swf))

If you are looking for the original SWF archive, they can be found here:

\* NO SUPPORT as it is embedded into the exe. MacOS X it is simple as opening Don't Look Back.app
as it is a folder and Resources > movie.swf. That is also the reason MacOS apps are wrapped in
a DMG, because you can't download folders directly.

\*\* Partially Supported. Available for download as a SWF but not decompiled due to ugly Flash hosters
in this case, Kongregrate - pushing developers into putting all their bullshit defunct ad APIs into
there. Removing MochiAD **and** Kongregrate APIs would be too much of a hassle in my opinion. Just stick to
the basics lmfao.
