Haxe Port by Buggem
------------------------

A port of the decompiled ActionScript to Haxe.

NOTE: Do NOT use the src folder. It is pure decompiled AS3 without any modifications made, meaning it may not compile as intended.
NOTE NOTE: As certain versions of Adobe Flash Player (at least for me) have a bug regarding the sound, which makes sound return NULL. For that patch, use the /haxe/src directory.
